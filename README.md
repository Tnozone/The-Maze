This is a level for a 2D game made in the style of old games like Doom. I love video games and I've always been curious about making one. I think this project was a good starting point if I ever want to pursue this further, though I may try to learn to make a 2D platformer next like one of my peers did. But from this base, I hope to make larger levels and give the player more to do. It was also nice to get back into creating sprite art, as I previously went to a school for design and illustration. It felt good making use of my old skills.
